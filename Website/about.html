    <h2>Brief Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            In the <a href="index.html">Home</a> section, you learned about how I was 
            involved on campus at Northeastern! In this section, you'll learn about my 
            music life, which was before college!
        </p>

        <p>
            Even though I consider myself an aspiring data scientist, I have always been
            a classical musician. I've been playing the piano since I was 5 years old, and I started 
            learning the cello at 11 years old. So if you do the math, I've been playing the 
            piano for almost 15 years and the cello for 8 years!! Although I can proudly say this,
            this was never easy, as I went to so many private lessons growing up as a kid. While it's
            true that I may have been forced by my parents as a child, my decision to continue playing
            these instruments are now at my own will, as music makes up my identity. Without music, I don't 
            even know how I would have gone through the toughest moments of my life.

        <h2>Brief Rundown of My Music Background</h2>
            <p>
                I have had the blessing of going to a performing arts high school in
                New York City where I majored in both piano and cello!
            </p>
    
            <p>
                The opportunities I was able to have from this school felt so surreal at times.
                I've had the opportunity to perform a many venues across Lincoln Center! Like I said 
                earlier, this process was never easy, but looking back on it, I don't regret a second
                of it because it has shaped me into the person I am today. Even though I had no interest
                in becoming a professional musician in high school, I'm so glad of the valuable lessons 
                I've learned.
