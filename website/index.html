        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            Hey there! I'm Daniel Ku, and I am currently a second year data science student
            at Northeastern University! I've had so much fun during my almost two years in college so far,
            as I would have never thought I would be involved in so many different clubs. I'm currently
            involved in the Asian Student Union and campus radio station. With the Asian Student Union,
            I am on a committee for the mentorship program called ASU Minis! On this committee, we try to 
            acclimate new students, both first year and transfer undergraduate students, to the Boston campus by pairing them 
            to upperclassmen students based on majors, hobbies, and interests! It's been such a great time making 
            such meaningful pairings and seeing how these students are grown in just a couple months into the 
            school year! 
            
            I'm also involved in the campus radio station called WRBB! I broadcast Northeastern basketball games
            that happen here in Boston! This is something new that I've been trying, and I've been having such a 
            blast doing this. It combines both my knowledge of statistics and communication! I've grown up watching
            all the four major sports in America: basketball, baseball, football, and ice hockey. This has been a 
            great way to stay involved in sports and meet new people!
